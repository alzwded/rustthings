So I'm studying rust.

The first project was to see if I can be as competent as I was 10 years ago by porting a bit of C code from a decade prior and seeing if I can get it to run as efficiently. This project downscales an image using a not-so-very-good method that somehow involves `atan`.

The studies are going well.
